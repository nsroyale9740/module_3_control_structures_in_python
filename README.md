Python Assignment 2 - Control Structures in Python

This repository contains solutions for Module 3: Control Structures in Python.
It includes two tasks demonstrating the use of conditional statements and loops in Python.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

Takes an integer input from the user.

Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

Displays the result accordingly.

Example Output:

Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.


File: task1_even_odd.py

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.

Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.

Displays the final sum.

Example Output:

The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275


File: task2_sum_1_to_50.py

How to Run the Programs

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/nsroyale9740/module_3_control_structures_in_python.git


Navigate to the repository:

cd python-assignment2


Run the programs:

python task1_even_odd.py
python task2_sum_1_to_50.py

Concepts Covered

Conditional Statements (if, else)

Loops (for loop)

User Input Handling (input() function)

Basic Arithmetic Operations

Printing Formatted Output

Validation and Error Handling

Ensures valid integer input for checking even or odd.

Handles invalid input gracefully using try-except where applicable.
